        * HTB,Pentesterlab,Pentester Academy, rootme , THM,PortSwigger, Hacker101, ctfchallenge.com  and like that many  other ctfs 
    * It will build your skills to high level
    * blog.intigriti => have a section of CTFs + challenges => just keep an eye on it and grab all those and start practising
