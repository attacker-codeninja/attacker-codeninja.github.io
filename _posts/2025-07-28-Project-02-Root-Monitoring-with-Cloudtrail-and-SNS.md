# 🔐 Project 2: monitoring/ AWS Root Account Activity with CloudTrail + SNS — Guided by a Security Engineer


This blog is all about - Setting Up Real-Time Alerts Like a Cloud Security Engineer

## 📌 Introduction — The Root of All Risks

Let me tell you a quick story.

When I first created my AWS account, the most powerful key I held was the **root account** - the "super admin" of everything in the cloud.  

But guess what? **Using it is a bad idea.** Like really bad.

> Think of the root account like a master key to a bank vault.  
> If it’s used casually, or worse - compromised - your entire cloud setup is at risk.

In this project, I wanted to learn **how to monitor AWS root account activity in real time** - and set up alerts so that if **anyone (even me)** logs in with it, I’ll know **immediately**.

Let’s dive in!

---

## 🎯 Objective

Simulate a real-world risky action:  
➡️ Log in as the **root user**,  
➡️ Perform a sensitive action (like disabling MFA), and  
➡️ Detect that activity using:

- **CloudTrail** for logging
    
- **SNS** for alerts
    
- **CloudWatch (EventBridge)** for triggering the detection


So -> **Detect and respond to sensitive activity performed by using the AWS Root Account, which should be tightly controlled and rarely used.**


---

## ⚠️ Why is Root Account Usage a Security Red Flag?

By default, AWS allows you to create and manage your account with a **root user**, but here’s what makes it dangerous:

| 🚨 Risk            | Why It's a Problem                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Full permissions | Can delete everything in AWS - no restrictions |
| ❌ MFA disabled     | Easy target for attackers                      |
| 🤫 Hard to track   | Used rarely, so any activity is suspicious     |
| 🔥 No boundaries   | Can override all IAM permissions               |


So as a security engineer (even a beginner one), we **never want to use root unless absolutely necessary.**  
But if someone _does_ use it? That’s an event worth knowing **immediately**.

---

## 🧰 Services Used

Here’s what we’ll use to make our alert system:

|AWS Service|Purpose|
|---|---|
|CloudTrail|Logs every action taken in AWS|
|CloudWatch / EventBridge|Detects specific patterns (like root login)|
|SNS|Sends an alert via Email/SMS|
|IAM|Identity system (helps us know who did what)|

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup: Root Account monitoring/ in AWS

> Don't worry, each step includes what and _why_ we’re doing it. ❤️

---

### ✅ Step 1: Simulate the Problem — Log in as Root

**Why this step?**  
We want to see how CloudTrail captures this risky action.

- Go to AWS Console
    
- Log in **using the root account email**
    
- Navigate to **Billing Dashboard** or **Account Settings**
    
- Try to **disable MFA** (if enabled)
	

🧠 This simulates a “sensitive operation” - exactly what an attacker might try.

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728100924.png)


---

### 📝 Step 2: Enable CloudTrail (if not already)

**What is CloudTrail?**  
It’s AWS’s built-in logging system. 

Every time _someone does something_ (login, create S3 bucket, delete EC2 instance, etc.), CloudTrail writes it down.


#### ✅ Open CloudTrail Service

- Go to the **AWS Console**, search for **“CloudTrail”** in the search bar, and click the result.
    
- Click **"Create trail"**.

#### 📝 Configure the Trail:

- **Trail name:** I named it **RootActivityTrail** to clearly reflect its purpose.
    
- You may **not see options to choose Management/Event types or enable for all regions**, because CloudTrail **does this automatically now** during the setups.
    
    - ✅ CloudTrail **enabled Multi-region trail** by default - so activity in _all_ AWS regions will be captured.
        
    - ✅ CloudTrail also **created a dedicated S3 bucket** to store logs (you’ll see its name under the “S3 bucket” column later).

💡 **Important Note:**

> When I tried this, I didn’t even need to create the S3 bucket manually. AWS CloudTrail smartly created a bucket named something like:
> 
> **aws-cloudtrail-logs-677604542474-fdc96c6b**

This automatic bucket creation makes life easier - especially for beginners!


✅ Done. Now, every action - including root login - will be logged.


![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728101102.png)


![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728101124.png)


![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728101220.png)


![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728101315.png)


![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728101935.png)


So this step was about **turning on the security cameras** (CloudTrail) and **pointing them at the most sensitive area** (root account actions).


If anyone uses the root account - whether it’s you or someone malicious - we’ll **catch it immediately** in our logs.

---

### 🔔 Step 3: Set Up SNS — Our Alerting System

**Why SNS?**  
SNS (Simple Notification Service) can send alerts to email or SMS.

- Go to **SNS → Topics → Create Topic**
    
    - **Name:** **RootLoginAlerts**
    - In the **"Create topic"** screen:

- ✅ **Type**: Choose **Standard** (default)
    
    - Best-effort ordering
        
    - At-least once message delivery
        
    - Supports multiple protocols like Email, Lambda, SQS
        
- 🧠 _Why not FIFO?_  
    FIFO topics are mainly for ordering and deduplication in SQS - unnecessary for notifications. Standard gives us flexibility for email alerts.
    
- Right now, your SNS topic doesn’t know **where** to send the alert. We need to **subscribe your email address** so you get notified instantly when the root account logs in.
- Click on the topic → **Create subscription**
    
    - **Protocol:** Email
        
    - **Endpoint:** Your personal email
        
- Check your inbox and **confirm the subscription**



📧 Now you're ready to receive alerts.


![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728102322.png)

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728103043.png)

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728103427.png)


> Though i used temp email but you need to use proper active email as you will get a confirmation link you **must** click before alerts start coming.

### 🔐 Why This Step Is Critical for Security

Just logging a root user login event isn’t enough. **You need to be notified immediately**, in case it wasn’t you.

Real-world misconfig:

> Many engineers set up CloudTrail and even an SNS Topic, but **forget to subscribe an endpoint**. So when root login happens, they never find out.

We’re not making that mistake. 😉 You’ll get alerted within seconds of a root login.


---

### 📡 Step 4: Create CloudWatch Rule (EventBridge)

We now tell AWS:  
**“If anyone logs in using the root user, send me an alert.”**

First, Let's know about CloudWatch and EventBridge

#### 🤔 CloudWatch vs EventBridge — What’s the Deal?

If you're confused about where to create the alert rule — whether in **CloudWatch** or **EventBridge** - you're not alone.

Here's the truth in simple terms:

> **EventBridge is the upgraded version of CloudWatch Events.**

You’ll still hear a lot of tutorials and documentation saying:

> "Create a CloudWatch Event Rule…"

But when you go to AWS Console, there’s no “Events” section inside CloudWatch anymore. Instead, AWS has **moved that feature into a service called** **Amazon EventBridge**.


##### ✅ So what does this mean for you?

- **Yes**, you're technically still creating a _CloudWatch Event Rule_
    
- **But**, you now create it inside **EventBridge**, not CloudWatch
    
- **Behind the scenes**, it’s using the **same API** - just a new UI and new name
    
- **Bonus**: EventBridge has cool new features (like Schema Registry, Pipes, Partner Events)
    

Here’s how AWS explains it:

> EventBridge was formerly called CloudWatch Events. EventBridge uses the same CloudWatch Events API, so your existing setup still works - just with more features.


##### 🚧 Why This Matters for Security Engineers

If you're monitoring/ root account usage (like we are in this project), you'll often find old blogs telling you to:

> "Create a CloudWatch Event Rule for root login."

But when you go to CloudWatch in the AWS Console… no such thing exists anymore.  
👉 That’s because it’s all inside **EventBridge** now!

So don’t get stuck - just remember:

> 💡 When someone says "CloudWatch Rule,"they mean an "EventBridge Rule" now.


See this -> 

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728110237.png)


Why AWS Shows Both CloudWatch and EventBridge?

- **CloudWatch** still handles **metrics, dashboards, alarms, logs**.
    
- **EventBridge** now handles **event rules and routing**, which **used to be called CloudWatch Events**.
    

So both services exist for different **monitoring/ and response purposes**.


So ->

|Feature|Use This Service|
|---|---|
|Metrics, logs, alarms|CloudWatch|
|Event rules/triggers|**EventBridge** (new name for CloudWatch Events)|



**Think of EventBridge as the "postal system" of AWS.**  

It listens for “events” (like someone uploading a file to S3 or starting an EC2 instance), and then **automatically sends those events to specific targets** (like Lambda, SNS, SQS, Step Functions) based on rules you define.

It's **fully serverless**, scalable, and great for **event-driven automation**.



![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728110558.png)


So there is many components right now like EventBridge Rule, EventBridge Pipes etc
Let's first know about this and which one we need for this time

1. **EventBridge Rule**
	1. "When **this** happens, do **that**"
	2. **Example**: When someone modifies an S3 bucket policy (event), send alert to SNS (target).
	3. You define a **rule** that listens for a pattern in events and sends matching events to the **target** service.
2. **EventBridge Pipes** (NEW Feature)
	1. Directly **connect an event source to a target** - like a pipe.
	2. Useful for **streaming-style processing**.
	3. You can even **filter and enrich** the event in between using Pipes.
	4. **Example**: Send filtered DynamoDB stream events to Lambda.
3. **EventBridge Schedule**
	1. Like a **cron job**.
	2. Trigger a target (e.g., Lambda, Step Function) **at fixed intervals** - daily, weekly, every minute, etc.
	3. **Example**: Check IAM role age every 24 hours and rotate if needed.
4. **EventBridge Schema Registry**
	1. A place to **collect and organize all your event structures**.
	2. It auto-discovers the **shape** (JSON structure) of incoming events.
	3. Great for developers building apps that consume AWS events.


#### 🤯 Why Is EventBridge Important for Security Engineers?

1. **Automated Detection**
    
    - Detect changes like EC2 starting, IAM policy changes, S3 public access attempts.
        
    - Automatically **trigger Lambda or notify** via SNS/Slack/Email.
        
2. **Real-Time Response**
    
    - EventBridge + Lambda can **auto-revert misconfigurations** (e.g., make an S3 bucket private again if someone makes it public).
        
3. **Audit & monitoring/**
    
    - Forward events to S3 or CloudWatch Logs for **security auditing**.
        
    - Build alerts on suspicious activity.
        
4. **Decoupled Architecture**
    
    - Improves your security system design by **decoupling** detection and response logic.



Let's come to our Project now ->

* Select **EventBridge Rule** and click on **Create Rule**

We will see this ->

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728111505.png)


* Let's choose Name -> **DetectRootLogin**
* Rule Type -> **Rule with an event pattern**


![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728111744.png)


We Selected **Rule with an Event Pattern** - Bt Why ?

> Trigger this rule **only when a specific event** happens
> So This is for **event-driven automation**
> When that exact pattern happens, AWS triggers the rule.
> **This is what you want for _security monitoring/_** - listen for specific activities like **root account usage**.


But What about **Rule with a Schedule** ?

> Trigger this rule **every X minutes/hours/days** no matter what
> You define a **fixed cron schedule** (like “run every 1 hour”).
> Useful for periodic checks or batch jobs
> This is **not** what we need right now because we're not doing something on a time schedule - we're reacting to a real-time event.


We will now see following screen ->

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728112144.png)


* Keep Selected **AWS events or EventBridge partner events**
* Event Pattern → Creation method
	* Keep selected: **Use pattern form** (default and easier)
* **Even Source** -> AWS Services
* **AWS Service** ->
	* Select: `CloudTrail`
	* Because all console login events — including root user logins — are logged by CloudTrail
* **Event type** -> 
	* Select: AWS API Call via CloudTrail


So Far we will see this ->

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728112638.png)


So We get this ->

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.cloudtrail"],
  "detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"],
  "detail": {
    "eventSource": ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"]
  }
}
```


Before knowing about this , let's first know what exactly is this

What is an **Event Pattern** in EventBridge?

> Imagine you are the **security guard** at a giant office building (your AWS account). You’re watching hundreds of employees (AWS services and users) coming in and doing all kinds of activities - uploading files, running servers, logging in, deleting data.

But you don’t care about everything. You only want to be **notified** when something **specific** happens - like **"someone enters using the CEO’s master key"** (Root account login).

That’s where **EventBridge event patterns** come in.

**An Event Pattern is like a filter rule.**

It tells AWS:  
"Hey, I only care about **this kind** of event. Ignore everything else."

AWS services constantly emit **events** - structured JSON messages - about what’s happening in your account. EventBridge listens to these events and **matches** them against your pattern.

Only when the pattern **matches**, your rule is triggered - and the target (email, Lambda, SNS) is notified.

So, we saw Pattern above , let's know about that pattern ->

### What it does:

- Catches **every API call** logged by CloudTrail.
    
- Very broad - will **flood** you with too many notifications.
    
- Not suitable for alerting on specific logins like root.

So, instead of this Pattern we need following **Corrected Pattern** ->

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.signin"],
  "detail-type": ["AWS Console Sign In via CloudTrail"],
  "detail": {
    "eventName": ["ConsoleLogin"]
  }
}

```


* Just Click on Edit and save above Corrected Pattern there

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728113354.png)


### What it does:

- Triggers **only** on AWS Console sign-in attempts.
    
- **ConsoleLogin** is the specific event name for sign-ins.
    
- This event includes fields like:
    
    - `userIdentity.type`: e.g., `Root`, `IAMUser`, `AssumedRole`
        
    - `responseElements.ConsoleLogin`: `Success` or `Failure`
        
- You can further filter by root user later (we'll see this in SNS or Lambda filters or in CloudWatch alarms).



## 🧪 How does this help us?

- **Noise reduction**: You only get alerted for actual sign-ins, not every API call.
    
- **Security focus**: You care about who logs into your account, especially root.
    
- **Flexible filtering**: You can later narrow this pattern to:
    
    ```json
    "userIdentity.type": ["Root"]
    ```
    
- **Real-time alerts**: As soon as this login happens, EventBridge triggers an action - like sending an email or a Slack message.


Next we will see following screen ->

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728113819.png)


Before going further, let's know about this steps as well ->

> A **Target** is _what should happen_ when the rule is triggered.


We already defined the "when" using our **event pattern** (e.g., someone logs in using the Root account).  
Now you must tell AWS:  
👉 **"Okay, this just happened — now do this!"**

We see 3 Options above as you see -> Let's know about this as well ->

|Target Type|What It Does|
|---|---|
|**EventBridge Event Bus**|Sends the event to another EventBridge bus (advanced use case)|
|**EventBridge API destination**|Sends the event to a 3rd-party SaaS system via HTTPS|
|**AWS service** ✅|Triggers an action in any AWS service (like SNS, Lambda, SQS, Step Functions, etc.)|

In Out Case -> want to be **notified when root login happens**, so we'll choose:

✅ **AWS Service → SNS (Simple Notification Service)**



So Select a Target for SNS ->

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728114216.png)


##### Why Choose SNS?

- SNS lets you **send emails**, **SMS**, or even forward to other AWS services.
    
- You can subscribe your **email address** to a topic.
    
- So as soon as the event happens, you get a **real-time alert** like:
    

> 📧 Subject: **Root Login Detected in AWS**
> 
> "A ConsoleLogin event was detected for the Root user. This is a serious security concern..."


Now we will see more options ->

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728114245.png)


Let's know about this as well ->

|Option|When to Use|Your Case|
|---|---|---|
|**Target in this account**|If your SNS topic is in the **same AWS account**|✅ YES – this is the default and correct choice for now|
|**Target in another AWS account**|If the SNS topic lives in another AWS account|❌ No – not needed unless you're doing cross-account alerts|


Next I choosed following Topic -> as we already created this SNS topic

![](/assets/img/project-2-root-account-monitoring/20250728114448.png)

🟢 This means: "Whenever root login happens, send that alert to this topic."

Next is **Permission** ->

This section tells EventBridge **how it is allowed to call SNS** on your behalf.

You will see these:

###### Option 1: ✅ **Use execution role (recommended)**

This is what we want! It allows EventBridge to assume a role and publish to SNS.


Next we see -> **Execution role**

|Option|What It Does|Recommendation|
|---|---|---|
|**Create a new role for this specific resource**|EventBridge will auto-create a minimal IAM role just for this rule|✅ Best for beginners and small projects|
|**Use existing role**|If you have a custom IAM role with SNS publish permissions|❌ Skip unless you’re customizing permissions deeply|

So far -> 

|Setting|What to Select|
|---|---|
|**Target location**|`Target in this account`|
|**Topic**|Select your SNS topic (e.g., `RootLoginAlertTopic`)|
|**Permissions**|`Use execution role (recommended)`|
|**Execution Role**|`Create a new role for this specific resource`|

✅ This way, AWS will create the correct IAM role behind the scenes, attach necessary permissions, and you won’t need to worry about IAM policy writing manually.


Next Step -> **Tags** -> Optional
Next Step -> **Review and create** -> Create Rule 

Done

We will see this ->

#### ✅ Here's What Just Happened (Step-by-Step Summary):

| ✅ Step                 | What You Did                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 👁️ Identified Event   | You filtered for `Root login` via `cloudtrail.amazonaws.com`             |
| ⚙️ Created Rule        | You used **EventBridge Event Pattern** to match login events             |
| 📣 Chose SNS Target    | You picked your `RootLoginAlerts` SNS topic to send notifications        |
| 🔐 Set Permissions     | EventBridge was granted permission to publish to SNS                     |
| 🎯 Final Result        | ✅ `DetectRootLogin` rule now watches for Root logins and triggers alerts |



---

### Step 5: Test the Setup

Now go back and **login again as Root** (without MFA).

💥 You should receive an email like:

> **ALERT: AWS Root Login Detected Without MFA**  
> Take immediate action.


ALSO ->

Open **CloudTrail > Event History**, filter for **ConsoleLogin** events, and then confirm for `userIdentity.type` is  **"Root"** or not


---

## ✍️ What I Did & What I Learned

### ✅ What I Did

- Created a CloudTrail trail to monitor all activity.
    
- Configured SNS to alert me for risky root actions.
    
- Set up EventBridge rule to detect root login.
    
- Tested by logging in as root and received instant email alert.
    

### 🤯 What I Learned

- AWS **doesn’t block** root usage, but it expects **you to monitor it**.
    
- CloudTrail + SNS + EventBridge is a powerful combo to detect threats in real-time.
    
- Automating this alert is a basic but **critical security hygiene** step.
    
- Even as a beginner, I felt like I was doing something real - like what pros do in production setups.



---

## 🔐 Final Reflection (For Beginners)

If you’re new to AWS security, let this sink in:

> "Security isn't always about locking everything down.  
> It’s about being **aware**, setting **detection mechanisms**, and **responding quickly.**"

You’ve just done your first **real-world threat detection** setup. Be proud!  
And never, ever use the root account casually again. ☠️


## 🧾 Next Steps (Optional Ideas)

- Set up alerts for when **someone deletes CloudTrail** (yes, it happens).
    
- Store logs in a **versioned S3 bucket** to prevent tampering.
    
- Use AWS Config to monitor whether MFA is enabled on root at all times.

# 🔐 Security Engineer Insight — "The Root Account Is the Crown Jewel. Guard It Like a Secret Weapon."


As a security engineer, I’ve seen this  - companies lock down everything _except_ the one identity that can destroy it all: the **root user**.

Let’s be honest :

> Most beginners don’t realize that the root account is **not meant for daily use**.  
> One misstep here isn’t a misconfiguration - it’s a **full-blown breach** waiting to happen.

In this project, I wanted to simulate what _actually goes wrong_ when a root login is **not being monitored** - and then show you exactly how to fix it.

This wasn’t about fancy tools. It was about building **the one alarm that matters most** - the one that tells you:

> **Someone just entered the kingdom.**

We leveraged **CloudTrail**, **SNS**, and **EventBridge Rules** to set up a low-cost, high-value root monitoring/ pipeline.

## ✅ What We Built

By the end of this project, we had a **fully working detection & alerting mechanism** for AWS root account usage. 

Here’s a breakdown:


| Component            | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛡️ CloudTrail Trail | Custom trail (`RootActivityTrail`) created with multi-region + global services logging  |
| 🎯 Event Selector    | Filtered to capture only `ConsoleLogin`  events for **Root user ARN**                   |
| 🔁 EventBridge Rule  | Custom pattern matching on root login events triggering SNS                             |
| 📬 SNS Notification  | Root login alerts sent to email via SNS topic - tested and confirmed working            |
| ⚠️ Manual Simulation | Root login simulated and CloudTrail logs + SNS alerts verified                          |

In short: **root login now triggers an email within ~5 minutes**.  
This is **real detection engineering** on cloud - not theory, not guesswork.

## 🧠 What I Learned from This Project (If I Were a Beginner)

If I were a beginner learning this for the first time, here’s what I would’ve taken away:

1. **CloudTrail Alone Isn’t Enough — You Need EventBridge for Real-Time Detection**  
    Most assume CloudTrail is "security." But unless paired with EventBridge rules and SNS, it's just **logging, not alerting**.
    
2. **The Root ARN is Special — Treat It Differently in Event Patterns**  
    Matching the exact string `"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"` is critical. Even a minor mismatch leads to **no alerts**.
    
3. **S3 Logging Delay is Real**  
    Just because you don’t see the logs instantly doesn’t mean it’s broken. AWS may take a few mins to deliver events to S3.
    
4. **SNS is Simple But Powerful**  
    Using email as the alert channel is great for MVPs. Later, you can integrate Slack, PagerDuty, or even Lambda functions for automated response.
    
5. **Security Isn’t About Blocking Only — It’s About Knowing What Just Happened**

Root account access in AWS is like having the master key to your entire digital kingdom. 

While IAM policies, S3 buckets, and EC2 permissions often grab all the attention, **real breaches often begin where no one’s watching — the root user**.

This project wasn’t just a technical lab - it was a wake-up call. 

If you're learning cloud security, **start with visibility**, especially for the identities that can destroy everything in seconds.

Monitor the root account. Alert on it. Treat it like a **break-glass-only identity**.  

Because when it gets used, you shouldn't be finding out days later 

You should know **before the attacker logs out**.

Stay tuned for more Projects
